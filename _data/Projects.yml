        <div style="flex: 1; line-height: 1.5;">RepRadar is a civic engagement web app that helps users stay informed about their local representatives and the latest Executive Orders by zip code. Built in two weeks with a team of six developers, the app uses React, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, and external APIs.<br><br>

          •  Pitched the concept, sourced key APIs, and contributed across the stack—from designing a RESTful backend and managing real-time data to building responsive frontend components.<br><br>
          •  Led development of the Executive Orders feature, including data retrieval, filtering, conditional saving to user profiles, and building full list and detail views to improve usability.<br><br>
          •  As a stretch goal, integrated OpenAI to generate readable summaries and built a homepage ticker that displays the five most recent Executive Orders in real time.

      <div style="flex: 1; line-height: 1.5;">Samovar Admin Portal is a full-stack application that allows users to manage tea subscriptions, view customer profiles, and explore tea details. Built solo using a Rails API backend and a React frontend, with a focus on scalable data modeling, test-driven development, and a user-friendly interface.<br><br>

          •  Designed and implemented a custom backend with RESTful routes, model-level validations, and business logic for filtering and sorting, including safeguards for update/delete failures.<br><br>
          •  Wrote comprehensive request and model specs using RSpec, generated seed and test data with FactoryBot and Faker, and built in custom error handling for invalid requests.<br><br>
          •  Developed a responsive frontend in React and tested core user flows using Cypress.

    #   - I focused on writing clean, RESTful controllers, moving business logic into the models (such as sorting by price), and ensuring data integrity with model-level validations, comprehensive test coverage, and custom error handling to return user-friendly responses when updates or deletions failed.
    #   - On the frontend, I built a responsive React interface and wrote end-to-end tests using Cypress to ensure core user flows worked as expected.
