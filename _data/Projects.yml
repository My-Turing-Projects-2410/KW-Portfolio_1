      - RepRadar is a civic engagement web application and tool that helps users stay informed about their local representatives and the latest Executive Orders by zip code, built with a team of five other developers in two weeks, using React, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, and external APIs.
      - For this project, I pitched the concept to my team and sourced the external APIs that would achieve allow us to achieve our goals, including the Federal Register and OpenAI. It gave me hands-on experience designing a RESTful backend and handling real-time data parsing and storage.
      - My primary focus was building out the Executive Orders feature—retrieving, filtering, and conditionally saving them to a user’s profile—as well as constructing both the full list and detailed views to improve UX.
      - One of our stretch goals was using OpenAI to generate readable summaries of each Executive Order, which I successfully implemented alongside a homepage ticker that updates with the five most recent orders.

      <div style="flex: 1; line-height: 1.5;">Samovar Admin Portal is a full-stack application built with a Rails API backend and a React frontend that allows users to manage tea subscriptions, including viewing detailed information about customers and the teas in their subscriptions. As a solo project, I designed and implemented a full backend from scratch while also planning for future scalability in the data model. I wrote request and model specs, handled edge cases like invalid subscription IDs, and used FactoryBot and Faker to generate realistic test and seed data.</div>
