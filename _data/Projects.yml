          RepRadar is a civic engagement web application that helps users stay informed about the latest Executive Orders and connect with their local representatives. Built in two weeks with a team of six developers, the app uses React, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, and external APIs.<br><br>
          <div style="padding-left: 20px; line-height: 1.5; font-size: 0.95em;">
            •  I pitched the idea, sourced key APIs, and contributed across the stack—from designing a RESTful backend and managing real-time data to building responsive frontend components.<br><br>
            •  Led development of the Executive Orders features, including data retrieval, filtering, conditional saving to user profiles, and building full list and detail views to improve usability.<br><br>
            •  As a stretch goal, integrated OpenAI to generate readable summaries and built a homepage ticker that displays the five most recent Executive Orders in real time.
