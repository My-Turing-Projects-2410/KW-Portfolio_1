    description: |
      Award-winning Film Producer turned Software Developer, blending a decade of storytelling expertise with technical skills in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and React. My journey into tech began while seeking better solutions for content workflows and combating misinformationâ€”issues I reported on while producing content for Netflix, HBO Max, and Forbes Health. 
      
      I bring a unique perspective that combines narrative crafting with logical problem-solving, allowing me to create intuitive, purpose-driven applications. Currently seeking opportunities where I can leverage my dual background to develop media technology solutions and creative workflow tools, while continuing to grow as a full-stack developer focused on information integrity and user experience. Please check out my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tzz4HrCKjA8bnrp1Nl3g-zjRM-qYbIj-/view?usp=sharing) for more details.
      
      When I'm not coding, you can find me working on independent film projects, exploring new technologies, or hiking in the California mountains.
